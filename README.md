# stock-analysis-assignment
Project Goal: Extract and visualize stock price (yfinance) and revenue (webscraping) for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME).
Libraries: Python, yfinance, pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, plotly.
How to Run: Install libraries (pip install...), open notebook, execute cells sequentially.
Findings:
TSLA: Both price and revenue show massive growth starting around 2020.
GME: Price had a sharp 2021 spike (meme stock event) that was disconnected from its slower revenue growth.
